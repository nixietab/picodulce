# Installation

## Windows
For Windows systems using the [installer](https://github.com/nixietab/picodulce/releases/latest) is recommended

## Arch Linux
The package is available in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/picodulce) as ```picodulce```

For installing on Arch without using an AUR helper a PKGBUILD is provided
```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/picodulce.git
cd picodulce
makepkg -si
```

## Other OS

### 1. Clone the repository

``` git clone https://github.com/nixietab/picodulce ```

### 2. (Optional) Set Up a Virtual Environment
Setting up a virtual environment is recommended to avoid dependency conflicts. Picodulce relies on the path of the `zucaro` project, and using a virtual environment helps prevent errors.

Create the virtual environment:

``` python -m venv venv ```

- **Linux/Mac:**  
  `source venv/bin/activate`
- **Windows:**  
  `.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate`
 


### Install requirements

Now on the venv you can install the requirements safely

```pip install -r requirements.txt ```

### Running the launcher

On the venv run it as a normal python script

```python picodulce.py```

Just make sure you have Java installed for running the actual game, or check the "manage java" option inside the launcher settings

### About the name
The name "Picodulce" comes from a popular Argentinian candy. This reflects the enjoyable and user-friendly experience that the launcher aims to provide, making game management straightforward and pleasant.
